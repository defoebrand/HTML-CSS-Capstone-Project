This project was compiled by Brandon in the HTML/CSS section of the Microverse course work as the HTML/CSS capstone project. It involved using this design: <https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX> to create a real-world-like project. Modeled after an electronics store, this is a medical supply store.

It includes a main page and a search page with all relevant links working, except the shopping cart, product request, page settings, login pages, and search results page numbers.

It includes two main breakpoints for above 768px and below 768px to accommodate desktop and mobile users.

Colors #d35266, #888, and #383838, as well as font styles Gotham-light, Gotham-bold, Helvetica-light, Helvetica-medium, and Helvetica-bold were used to match to design specs.

Particularly noteworthy is the sale class which can be applied to any card to create a sale banner, cross out the normal price, and add the sale price.
